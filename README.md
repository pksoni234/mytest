# jQuery Wizard Code

There is already some jQuery plugins to make wizards, but none to fit my needs and/or with a slide effect.
So I decide to build my own and share it.
easyWizard is pretty lightweight (5kb uncompressed), have some usefull options and is compatible with Chrome Chrome, Firefox Firefox, Opera Opera and Safari Safari.
I tried to make it simple to use and have some usefull options and hope it will be usefull to some people.
